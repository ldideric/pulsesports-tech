# PULSE Sport

A Progressive Web App made in a project week at the Bit Academy.

The Web application can be used on mobile phones,
and on browsers that can resize to mobile resolutions.

## Getting Started

To start clone the repository:\
`git clone git@github.com:ldideric/pulsesports-tech.git`\
You can open the app on your computer by hosting the site on a server, or using the VSCode Extension [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

You can add the site as a Progressive Web App in your browser, and access the site as an app.
